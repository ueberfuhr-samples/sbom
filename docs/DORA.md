# Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)

## What is it?

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is
an [EU regulation (2022/2554)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2554/oj) aimed at strengthening the

- cybersecurity and
- operational resilience

of

- financial institutions and
- their third-party service providers.

It establishes a comprehensive framework to ensure that financial entities can withstand, respond to, and recover from
ICT (Information and Communication Technology) disruptions, such as cyberattacks and system failures.

## How did it come about?

DORA was introduced as part of the
EU's [Digital Finance Package](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/digital-finance-package_en), which seeks to
modernize financial services while ensuring cybersecurity and consumer protection. The act was

- formally adopted on November 28th, 2022,
- came into force on January 16th, 2023,
- with a compliance deadline of January 17th, 2025.

## Why did it come about?

Key reasons for DORA’s introduction were:

1. Growing Cyber Threats
   - The financial sector is a prime target for cyberattacks, data breaches, and ransomware.
   - High-profile incidents, such as attacks on banks and financial institutions, highlighted the need for stronger
     regulatory measures.
2. Fragmented Regulations
   - Before DORA, financial firms followed different cybersecurity rules across EU member states, leading to
     inconsistencies and vulnerabilities.
   - DORA harmonizes these regulations across the EU, ensuring a unified approach to cybersecurity.
3. Digital Transformation of Finance
   - The increasing use of cloud services, AI, and blockchain in finance created new risks.
   - DORA ensures that digital innovations do not compromise financial stability.
4. Third-Party Risks
   - Many financial firms outsource IT services to third-party providers, like cloud computing and data management companies.
   - DORA introduces strict rules for monitoring and managing third-party ICT risks.

## Who does it apply to?

DORA applies to a wide range of financial entities, including:
- Banks
- Insurance companies
- Investment firms
- Payment service providers
- Crypto-asset service providers
- Third-party ICT service providers (e.g., cloud providers, data centers)

## What are the key requirements?

- **ICT Risk Management** – Financial firms must implement robust security controls and risk management strategies.
- **Incident Reporting** – Firms must report major cyber incidents within strict timelines.
- **Resilience Testing** – Regular testing, including penetration tests and scenario-based stress tests, is required.
- **Third-Party Risk Management** – Firms must assess and manage risks from outsourced ICT providers.
- **Information Sharing** – Encourages collaboration and sharing of cyber threat intelligence among financial institutions.
