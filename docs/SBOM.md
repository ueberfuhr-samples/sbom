# Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)

## What is it?

## Why do we need them?

Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) play a crucial role in [DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act)](DORA.md) compliance by improving transparency, security, and risk management in financial institutions' software supply chains.

DORA does not explicitly prescribe the use of SBOMs. However, its requirements around ICT risk management, third-party risk, and resilience testing strongly align with the benefits that SBOMs provide.

While SBOMs are not mandated, they can significantly help organizations meet DORA’s compliance requirements. Given the increasing focus on software transparency and cybersecurity, SBOMs are becoming an industry best practice and could be referenced in future regulatory guidance or audits under DORA.

Here’s how SBOMs help organizations meet DORA requirements.

### Enhanced ICT Risk Management (DORA Article 5)

SBOMs...
- ... provide detailed visibility into all software components, including open-source and third-party libraries.
- ... identify vulnerabilities and outdated components that could pose cybersecurity risks.
- ... support proactive risk assessments by tracking dependencies and potential security flaws.

### Faster Incident Response & Recovery (DORA Article 11)

SBOMs...
- ... enable rapid identification of affected software during a cyberattack or security incident.
- ... improve patch management by quickly finding and updating vulnerable components
- ... reduce downtime and financial losses by facilitating a structured response.

### Compliance with Resilience Testing (DORA Article 24)

SBOMs...
- ... facilitate security audits and penetration testing by mapping software components.
- ... help organizations simulate cyberattack scenarios and test system resilience.
- ... ensure continuous monitoring of software supply chain risks.

### Strengthening Third-Party Risk Management (DORA Article 28)

SBOMs...
- ... provide transparency into third-party software dependencies, reducing supply chain risks.
- ... ensure ICT service providers comply with secure coding practices and vulnerability management.
- ... help organizations enforce vendor security policies by requiring SBOMs from suppliers.

### Supporting Regulatory Reporting & Documentation (DORA Article 19)

SBOMs...
- ... serve as a detailed record of software components for regulatory audits.
- ... help organizations provide accurate and up-to-date security reports to regulators.
- ... ensure compliance with cybersecurity reporting obligations by tracking vulnerabilities systematically.

### Key Takeaways:
SBOMs...
- ... enhance cybersecurity posture and reduce risks from software vulnerabilities.
- ... enable faster response to incidents and regulatory inquiries.
- ... can be integrated into financial institutions' ICT risk management frameworks to streamline DORA compliance.
